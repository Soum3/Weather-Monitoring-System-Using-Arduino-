# Weather-Monitoring-System-Using-Arduino-
This weather station designed to measure weather parameters such as temparature,humidity, atmospheric pressure and air quality.
ARDUINO ΝΑΝΟ

Arduino nano is a microcontroller board Designed by Arduino.cc.

The microcontroller used in the Arduino nano is Atmega 328, the same one as used in the Arduino Uno.

It has wide range of applications and is a major Microcontroller board because of it small size and flexibility.

DHT22 TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSOR

The dht22 is a basic, low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor.

It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air, and spits out a digital signal on the data pin (no analog input pins needed).

MQ135 GAS SENSOR

The mq-135 gas sensor Senses gases like ammonia nitrogen, oxygen, alcohols and sulphide and smoke.

The operating voltage of this gas sensor is from 2..5V to 5V.

It has the potential to detect the harmful gases.

• Fast response and high sensitivity

Stable and long life.BMP280 PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE SENSOR

The bmp280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor.

The bmp280 is based on bosch's proven piezo-resistive pressure sensor technology featuring high accuracy and lincarity as well as long-term stability.

OLED DISPLAY

The 'OLED' stands for "organic light emitting diode"- a technology that uses LEDs in which the light is produced by organic molecules.

OLED display module is a precise small, white OLED module which can be interface with any microcontroller using SPI protocol.

It is having a resolution of 128×64.The package includes display board, display,6 pin male header.

WORKING

The aim of weather monitoring system is to detect and display various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, environmental pressure and air quality.

This system makes use of sensors for detecting and monitoring weather parameters.

OLED display is used to display the values of 
temperature and humidity.
